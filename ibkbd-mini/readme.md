# IBKBD

_Ibrahim's Keyboard_

- Custom physical layout, PCB, Case, and keymap
- 3x5 + 3 (Inspired by Absolem and Corne keyboards)
- DDC Choc keycaps
- Sunset Tactile Choc Switches
- NiceNano v2

I wanted to create an ultra portable version of the IBKBD-Full. This version uses low profile choc switches, does not have the gaming layer keys, and is a uni-body design.

#### In this project

- ergogen config
- completed kicad pcb
- generated 3d printing case files
- qmk keymap (substitute NiceNano)
- zmk keymap
