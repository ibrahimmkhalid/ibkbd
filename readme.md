Originally, I was using all the keys in my base layer when i started my journey in ergonomic keyboards. Over time I was able to learn to use less keys and rely on better layer management. Though gaming is still best achieved when using the full board size. Current default layout is inspired by [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku). My original keymap that used all keys on the board is saved in the "full" keymap.c file
